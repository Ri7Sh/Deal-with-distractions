The Weasley twins are up with their mischief and this time they are offering a deal - "If we offer an odd of 10/1 on a particular team, it means that for every one Galleons that the gambler puts at stake, he/she will earn ten Galleons in addition to the original stake.<br>If your team does not win then of course you will lose your stake and take home nothing!"So the Lee Jordan, the quidditch commentator, has announced that the odds of a team which is expected to win is worse off. He calls it an "upset" when a team beats an opposing team which has better chances of winning.<br>Jordan said, "Match 1 is between Chudley Cannons and Appleby Arrows. Cannons, a team with still a few faithful supporters is looking at the odds of 10/1 whereas Arrows seem to be in the race for the top with their odds as 1/4.""Match 2 is between Tutshill Tornadoes and Puddlemere United. Both have been good teams with Tornadoes winning five consecutive tournaments while United is ahead with 22 wins. <br>But this time Tornadoes is running on a low with odds of 7/2 while Puddlemere with their all time favourite keeper Oliver Wood, who played alongside famous Harry Potter is seeing the odds of 2/5."<br>"Match 3 is between Holyhead Harpies, the one and only all-girls team and Falmouth Falcons, known for its aggressive and often devious approach. This time the Harpies led by Gwenog Jones  has addition of Ginny Weasley, debuting as a Chaser. Dont get swayed by "All-Girls Team"- they are one of the most ferocious teams on field with an odd of 1/5. The Falcons with the odds of 20/1 should either pick up drastically on their technique or hope for a miracle to fight the girl power."</p>',
